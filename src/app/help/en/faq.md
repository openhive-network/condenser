# General

## <span id="What_is_Hive_blog">What is hive.blog?</span>

Hive has redefined social media by building a living, breathing, and growing social economy - a community where users are rewarded for sharing their voice. It's a new kind of attention economy.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="How_does_Hive_work">How does Hive.blog work?</span>

Hive.blog is one of the many websites that are powered by the Hive blockchain and HIVE cryptocurrency. All of these websites read and write content to the Hive blockchain, which stores the content in an immutable blockchain ledger, and rewards users for their contributions with digital tokens called HIVE.

Every day, the Hive blockchain mints new HIVE tokens and adds them to a community's "rewards pool". These tokens are then awarded to users for their contributions, based on the votes that their content receives. Users who hold more tokens in their account as "Hive Power" will get to decide where a larger portion of the rewards pool is distributed.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="How_does_Hive_differ_from_other_social_media_websites">How does Hive.blog differ from other social media websites?</span>

While most social media sites extract this value for the benefit of their shareholders, Hive believes that the users of the platform should receive the benefits and rewards for their attention and the contributions they make to the platform.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="What_do_I_need_to_do_in_order_to_secure_my_account">What do I need to do in order to secure my account?</span>

Unlike most social media websites, **there is no way to recover your account if you lose your password / owner key!** This is why it is extremely important that you save and backup your password somewhere safe. It is strongly recommended that you store an offline copy in case of a hard drive failure or other calamity. Consider digital offline storage, such as an external disk or flash drive, as well as printed paper stored in a fireproof safe. Use a safe deposit box for best redundancy.

If you leak your private key to another user or a third-party website, that user or website will have full access to your account. This means they can steal it, as well as the funds inside of it. It is therefore not recommended to enter your private key information with any other user or third-party website. If you believe your account has been compromised, you should change your password/keys right away.

Each account has multiple keys, which each have different levels of authority: owner, active, posting, and memo. The information on the different types of keys and their purposes, as well as more information on password and key security, can be found in the section on <a href="#Table_of_Contents_Security">Security</a>.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="Does_it_cost_anything_to_post__comment__or_vote">Does it cost anything to post, comment, or vote?</span>

No. It is free to post, comment, and vote on content on hive.blog. You might even get paid for it!

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="Can_I_earn_digital_tokens_on_Hive_How">Can I earn digital tokens on Hive? How?</span>

You can earn digital tokens on Hive by:

**Posting** - By sharing your posts, you can earn upvotes from community members. Depending on the upvotes you receive, you may get a portion of the "rewards pool".

**Voting and curating** - If you discover a post and upvote it before it becomes popular, you can earn a curation reward. The reward amount will depend on the amount of Hive Power you have.

**Purchasing** - Users can purchase Hive or Hive Dollar tokens directly through their Hive wallet using bitcoin, Ether, or BitShares tokens. They are also available from other markets and exchanges including [BlockTrades](https://blocktrades.us) and [Ionomy](https://ionomy.com).

**Vesting** - HIVE tokens that are powered up to Hive Power will earn a small amount of new tokens for holding.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="Where_do_the_tokens_come_from">Where do the tokens come from?</span>

The Hive network continually creates new digital tokens to reward content creators and curators. Some of the newly-created tokens are transferred to users who add value to Hive by posting, commenting, and voting on other people's posts. The remainder is distributed to holders of Hive Power and the witnesses that power the blockchain.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="Where_does_the_value_come_from">Where does the value come from?</span>

At its root, Hive is simply a points system. However, because this points system is blockchain-based, the points can be traded on markets as tokens. People buy and sell these tokens, and many hold in anticipation of increased purchasing power for various Hive-related services.

By analogy, Hive is a game system where users compete for attention and rewards by bringing content and adding value to the platform. The rewards people earn are tokens that have market value and are readily tradable. It is similar to how someone playing a video game could obtain a limited item or currency by playing the game. If the currency or items are transferable between users, then they can sell or buy them on game item markets.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="Why_are_people_getting_vastly_different_rewards">Why are people getting vastly different rewards?</span>

Hive is not a "get rich quick" scheme. While it is possible to post content that goes viral quickly and earn a lot of rewards on a single post, this is not typical for most users.

Most of the authors that you see earning high rewards are users that have spent a lot of time in the network building followings, making connections with others, and developing a reputation for bringing high quality content.

It is best to have realistic expectations, without focusing on rewards when you are first starting out. Work on building a following, making connections, and developing a good reputation. Consistency will pay off in the long run.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>

# Accounts

## <span id="Can_I_change_my_username">Can I change my username?</span>

Account names can not be changed. If you would like a new account name, you must pay to create a new account using a third-party account creation service.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Accounts">^</a>
## <span id="Can_I_delete_or_deactivate_my_account">Can I delete or deactivate my account?</span>

Accounts can not be deactivated or deleted. The account along with all of its activity is permanently stored in the blockchain.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Accounts">^</a>
# Community

## <span id="Am_I_required_to_verify_my_identity">Am I required to verify my identity?</span>

Verification is a process where users give evidence to show that they are the person that they claim to be.  This is to reduce fraud and people impersonating known figures. If you would like to remain anonymous, that is perfectly fine. However if you claim to be someone specific, the community may expect that you verify you are who you say you are.

There are a number of ways to do this. The most common way to verify your identity is by posting a link to your Hive profile on a website or social media account which you are already known for having such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, a blog, or photography site.

Many users also like to post a photo or a video which shows them holding up a sheet of paper with the current date and their Hive account name handwritten on it. This is a great way to add a personal touch to verifying.

## <span id="How_do_I_add_images_and_photos_to_my_posts">How do I add images and photos to my posts?</span>

You can browse your hard drive to add an image by clicking on the "selecting them" link from within the editor.

If you have an image copied to your clipboard, you can simply paste (`ctrl + v`) while in the post/comment editor, and your image will be uploaded into your post or comment. Due to the file size of these pasted images, this method is only recommended for simple graphics. Photos (.JPG) should be uploaded from your disk.

Pictures can also be hosted on an external site. Paste the image's web address (URL) into the editor and it will automatically be added.

## <span id="What_are_tags">What are tags?</span>

Tags are a way to categorize your content, so that others can find it. The more relevant the tags are to the post, the more like-minded people will come across it.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Posting">^</a>
## <span id="What_tags_should_I_use">What tags should I use?</span>

Try to use tags that are relevant to your post, and that will be popular for other people to browse. For example, "mytriptoalaska" may be relevant to your post, but readers are probably not going to go searching for that. Using "travel" would be a better choice for a tag in this case.

You can browse through commonly used tags using the "Explore" link, in the main menu.

Be mindful when choosing tags. If your tags aren’t related to your post, your post may get downvotes for mistagging.

All tags must be lowercase letters. Spaces aren't allowed, but hyphenated words with a single dash are.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Posting">^</a>
## <span id="How_many_tags_can_I_use">How many tags can I use?</span>

## <span id="How_often_can_I_post">How often can I post?</span>

You are allowed to post almost as often as you like. Currently, posts must be spaced 5 minutes apart. However, the community may not find value in users that are posting too frequently. Keep in mind what your audience will be interested in viewing, so that you do not overwhelm your followers with too much content.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Posting">^</a>
## <span id="How_long_can_my_post_be">How long can my post be?</span>

Post sizes are limited to about 64,000 characters including formatting. This is ample for most posts. If writing blogs, consider how much people are willing to read at one time. If you make your posts too long, readers may lose interest which may affect the amount of upvotes and rewards you receive.

## <span id="Can_I_delete_something_I_posted">Can I delete something I posted?</span>

The blockchain will always contain the full edit history of posts and comments, so it can never be completely deleted. If you would like to update a post so that users cannot see the content via hive.blog, you can edit the post and replace it with blank content for as long as the post is active. After seven days, the post can no longer be edited via hive.blog.

## <span id="What_does__Promoting__a_post_do">What does "Promoting" a post do?</span>

When you make a post, there is the option to promote it with Hive Dollars. It will then show up in the “Promoted” tab. The order that it appears in the list depends on how much the post was promoted for. Posts with a higher promoted amount will be higher than posts with less.

Hive Dollars spent to promote a post are paid to the account @null, which nobody owns or controls. Once a user transfers SBD to @null, the Hive blockchain removes them from the currency supply.

You can promote your own posts, or posts that you like from other users.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Posting">^</a>
## <span id="How_do_I_promote_a_post">How do I promote a post?</span>

At the bottom of each post is a button to "Promote". After clicking the button, type the number of Hive Dollars that you want to spend and click “PROMOTE”. The operation will require your master password or active key.

# Economics

## <span id="Where_do_the_new_HIVE_tokens_come_from">Where do the new HIVE tokens come from?</span>

Blockchains like Hive and Bitcoin produce new tokens each time a block is produced. Unlike Bitcoin, where all of the new coins go to the block producers (called miners), the Hive blockchain allocates a majority of the new tokens to a reward fund called the "rewards pool". The rewards pool gives users tokens for participating in the platform based on the value they add.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="How_many_new_tokens_are_generated_by_the_blockchain">How many new tokens are generated by the blockchain?</span>

Starting with the network's 16th hard fork in December 2016, Hive began creating new tokens at a yearly inflation rate of 9.5%. The inflation rate decreases at a rate of 0.01% every 250,000 blocks, or about 0.5% per year. The inflation will continue decreasing at this pace until the overall inflation rate reaches 0.95%. This will take about 20.5 years from the time hard fork 16 went into effect.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="How_are_the_new_tokens_distributed">How are the new tokens distributed?</span>

Out of the new tokens that are generated:
- 65% go to the reward pool, which is split between authors and curators.
- 15% of the new tokens are awarded to holders of Hive Power.
- 10% of the new tokens are awarded to the Hive Proposal System.
- The remaining 10% pays for the witnesses to power the blockchain.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="Which_exchanges_are_HIVE_and_HBD_listed_on">Which exchanges are HIVE and HBD listed on?</span>

HIVE and HBD are listed on the following exchanges:

| Exchange        | HIVE           | HBD  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| [BitShares](https://wallet.bitshares.org/)      | Y      |   Y |
| [BlockTrades](https://blocktrades.us) | Y      |    Y |
| [Ionomy](https://ionomy.com) | Y | N |

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="What_is_the_reward_pool">What is the reward pool?</span>

Every day, a fixed amount of HIVE tokens are allocated to the network reward fund, commonly called the "reward pool." These get distributed to authors and curators for posting and voting on content.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="How_is_the_reward_pool_split_between_authors_and_curators">How is the reward pool split between authors and curators?</span>

Up to 50% of a post's payout is awarded to curators (the people who upvoted the post) as a reward for discovering the content. The other 50% is awarded to the author.

If curators vote for a post within the first 5 minutes of it being created, a portion of their curation reward remains in the rewards pool for other authors/curators. This portion is linear to the age of the post between 0 and 5 minutes. As an example: upvoting at two minutes will donate 60% of your potential curation reward back to the rewards pool.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="Will_the_reward_pool_pay_out_more_or_less_depending_on_who_votes">Will the reward pool pay out more or less depending on who votes?</span>

There is a fixed amount of HIVE coins that gets added to the rewards pool each day. In the short term, the amount of coins that get paid out may be higher or lower depending on the amount of voting activity, but over time it will pay out the full amount of rewards regardless of who votes.

Votes in Hive are stake-weighted. Therefore voters with more Hive Power have a greater influence over the allocation than voters with less HP, but their votes do not increase the amount of rewards in the rewards pool.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="Why_do_the_earnings_for_my_post_go_up_or_down">Why do the earnings for my post go up or down?</span>

The amount that is shown next to a post is a "**Potential Payout**". This is an estimated value of how much money the post will make based on the votes that have occurred so far. Depending on various factors, this value can go up or down until the payout window closes:

- If a post receives more upvotes, the potential payout of the post can go up.
- If a post receives more downvotes, the potential payout of the post can go down.
- If other posts receive more upvotes, the potential payout of the post can go down.
- If other posts receive more downvotes, the potential payout of the post can go up.
- If upvotes are removed from a post, the potential payout of the post can go down.
- If downvotes are removed from a post, the potential payout of the post can go up.
- If the price of HIVE goes up, the potential payout of all posts can go up.
- If the price of HIVE goes down, the potential payout of all posts can go down.

## <span id="What_is_the_difference_between_HIVE__HIVE_Power__and_Hive_Dollars">What is the difference between HIVE, Hive Power, and Hive Dollars?</span>

**HIVE** - HIVE is the base liquid currency token in the platform. HIVE can be powered up into Hive Power, traded for Hive Dollars, or transferred to other accounts. It is a cryptocurrency token, similar to bitcoin.

**Hive Power** - Hive Power (abbreviated HP) is a measurement of how much influence a user has in the Hive network. The more Hive Power a user holds, the more they can influence the value of posts and comments. Hive Power is less liquid. If a user wishes to “Power Down” HP, they will receive equal distributions of the HIVE weekly, over a 13 week period.

**Hive Dollars** - Hive Dollars (commonly abbreviated HBD) are liquid stable-value currency tokens designed to be pegged to $1 USD. Hive Dollars can be traded with HIVE, and transferred to other accounts for commerce or exchange.  Hive Dollars may also be converted into HIVE via a process that takes 3.5 days. 

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="What_is_delegated_HIVE_Power">What is delegated Hive Power?</span>

Users have the option to delegate Hive Power to other users. When a user is delegated Hive Power - their Resource Credits, content votes, and curation rewards are calculated as if it were their own Hive Power. Users are not able to power down or cash out delegated Hive Power however, as it still belongs to the original owner.

Most users will have a small amount of Hive Power delegated to them by the Hive account after creating an account.

Delegated Hive Power shows up in a user's wallet below their actual Hive Power balance in parentheses.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="What_determines_the_price_of_HIVE">What determines the price of HIVE?</span>

The price of HIVE is based on the supply and demand of the token, as determined by buyers and sellers on the exchanges. It is similar to how the price of a commodity like gold is determined.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="How_do_I_get_more_HIVE_Power">How do I get more Hive Power?</span>

With HIVE tokens in your wallet, click "Power Up" to turn them into Hive Power. If you have Hive Dollars, you can convert them to HIVE from your wallet, and then power up the HIVE.

If you don’t already have HIVE or Hive Dollars in your wallet, you can purchase them using bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), or BitShares (BTS) tokens. You may purchase BTC on various exchanges, such as Coinbase.com or Localbitcoins.com.

To buy:
- Click "Buy Hive" from the main menu in the top right corner of hive.blog, or from your wallet.
- Select the currency to deposit, and enter the amount of that currency you wish to use.
- Enter your Hive account name (without the @) for "Your receive address".
- Click the "Get Deposit Address" button.
- Send the currency to the provided address.

HIVE purchases made via hive.blog are facilitated by <a href="https://blocktrades.us">BlockTrades</a>.

Bitcoin can also be exchanged for HIVE on external markets.

Transactions on the Hive blockchain typically only take about three seconds to process, but when you are purchasing the HIVE tokens using bitcoin or some other token, then the transaction must wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the other network. This can take several hours, and sometimes even days.    

If you paid using bitcoin, the third party website <a href="https://bitcoinfees.21.co/">bitcoinfees.21.co</a> can estimate the approximate wait time of the transaction based on the fees that were paid. The third party website <a href="https://blockchain.info/">blockchain.info</a> will lookup the fees that were paid on a specific blockchain transaction.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="What_is_powering_up_and_down">What is powering up and down?</span>

**Powering up** - If you have HIVE tokens, you can Power Up to Hive Power to get more voting influence on posts and comments. Having more Hive Power also increases the amount of curation rewards and new vested tokens that you can earn. More HP also grants more influence on approving Hive witnesses.

**Powering down** - If you have Hive Power, you can power down to turn it into liquid HIVE over a period of time. The system will transfer 1/13 of your Hive Power to HIVE each week for about three months (13 weeks), starting 1 week from the time it is started. However, you will lose your influence in the network proportionally to how much is powered down, so think about it carefully. Power downs can be stopped at any time.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="What_do_the_dollar_amounts_for_pending_payouts_represent">What do the dollar amounts for pending payouts represent?</span>

The dollar amounts next to posts and comments are estimates of the potential payout that will occur when the payout period ends, based on the current voting activity and price of HIVE. These potential payout amounts may fluctuate up or down until the payout period ends.

Payouts occur as a combination of Hive Power and Hive Dollars. Sometimes the blockchain may substitute HIVE in place of the Hive Dollars based on market conditions.

The blockchain estimates the dollar value of HIVE and Hive Power based on the 3.5 day average price of HIVE reported by the witnesses. The blockchain assumes Hive Dollars are worth approximately one USD.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="Will_1_Hive_Dollar_always_be_worth__1_00_USD">Will 1 Hive Dollar always be worth $1.00 USD?</span>

The market value of a Hive Dollar is dictated by the supply and demand of the token. Therefore it is possible for 1 HBD to be worth more or less than 1 USD depending on market conditions.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="How_do_Hive_Dollar_to_HIVE_conversions_work">How do Hive Dollar to HIVE conversions work?</span>

If you convert Hive Dollars to HIVE, the blockchain will process the transaction over a period of 3.5 days. At the end of the 3.5 days, the HBD will be gone and replaced by approximately $1 USD worth of HIVE tokens. The "approximately 1 USD worth of HIVE tokens" is based on the median HIVE price over the 3.5 days, using the price feeds from the Hive witnesses. Depending on price fluctuations during the 3.5 days it is possible to end up with more or less than $1 USD worth of HIVE per HBD at the end of the conversion. This is an advanced user feature, and is currently only available to users using external wallets.

No, you are not being paid by Hive. The Hive network rewards you. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions you make. Further, it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. Hive is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Hive transactions, or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any Hive transactions.

As you use more of your voting mana, your votes will carry less influence. A vote with 50% voting mana left will be worth 1/2 as much as a vote cast with 100% voting mana. Not to worry, the network recharges your voting mana by 20% every day.

## <span id="How_many_times_can_I_vote_without_depleting_my_voting_mana">How many times can I vote without depleting my voting mana?</span>

Every 100% vote you cast will use 2% of your remaining voting mana. Your voting mana will recharge by 20% each day. You can vote more than 10 times per day, but each vote will be worth less, and it will take longer to reach full voting mana again.

Each user also has a mana pool specifically for down votes. This pool is 25% of the upvote mana pool. Downvotes will consume this mana first before consuming regular mana. When voting, 1/50th of the remaining mana is used for a 100% vote. The same math is used for downvote mana but multiplied by 4 because the downvote mana pool is 25% the size of the normal mana pool. The maximum of these values is used. When both mana pools are at 100%, the values are the same. When downvote mana runs out normal mana is used in the same manner as the current behavior.

## <span id="Can_I_vote_with_less_than_100__of_my_voting_strength">Can I vote with less than 100% of my voting strength?</span>

New users can only upvote and downvote with 100% voting strength.

Once you reach about 500 Hive Power, you will see a vote slider appear when you vote. You can use the slider to adjust the weight of your vote, between 1% and 100% voting strength. Voting with less than 100% voting weight will use up less voting mana, but it will also have less of an influence on the post or comment's rewards.

## <span id="What_determines_how_much_of_the_curation_reward_goes_to_the_author_versus_curators">What determines how much of the curation reward goes to the author versus curators?</span>

The rewards are allocated so that 50% of the payout goes to the author of the post/comment, and 50% goes to the curator.

Of the 50% that goes to the curator, the curator will receive less than 100% if the curator votes within the first 5 minutes. The split of the 50% that the curator receives during the first 5 minutes is calculated linearly based on the time the vote is cast.

- If a post is upvoted the moment of posting, 100% of the curation reward will remain in the rewards pool.
- At 1 minute, the curator receives 20%, and 80% remains in the rewards pool.
- At 2 minutes, the curator receives 40%, and 60% remains in the rewards pool.
- At 3 minutes, the curator receives 60%, and 40% remains in the rewards pool.
- At 4 minutes, the curator receives 80%, and 20% remains in the rewards pool.
- If a post is upvoted 5 minutes (or later) after posting, 100% of the curation reward goes to the curator.

## <span id="Can_I_get_curation_rewards_for_upvoting_comments">Can I get curation rewards for upvoting comments?</span>

Yes. You can earn curation rewards from upvoting both posts and comments!

## <span id="Do_I_get_curation_rewards_for_downvoting_posts_or_comments">Do I get curation rewards for downvoting posts or comments?</span>

No. Since downvoting reduces the rewards on a post/comment, it does not earn curation rewards.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Voting_and_Curating">^</a>
## <span id="What_are_curation_trails">What are curation trails?</span>

Some users decide to use third party applications to automatically cast votes. Users can automatically vote for the same posts and comments that other users does. Typically they will set this up to follow the votes of users who are good at curating. When a user has other users automatically voting for the same content that they do, the people that automatically vote after them are called their "curation trail".

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Voting_and_Curating">^</a>
## <span id="Why_don_t_my_upvotes_have_an_effect_on_a_post_s_rewards">Why don't my upvotes have an effect on a post's rewards?</span>

A user with more HP is going to have a larger influence on the rewards than users with less HP. One vote from a user with a lot of HP can often have more of an effect than 100 votes from users with a small amount of HP.

Even though your vote may not have an immediate effect, when it gets added in along with all the other votes at the end of the payout period, it can still affect the payout. It may also cause more users to vote on the post too, because they saw that you upvoted it - so your votes can have an indirect effect on the payout this way.

## <span id="Is_there_a_way_to_make_my_votes_count_for_more">Is there a way to make my votes count for more?</span>

Yes. The more Hive Power you have, the more influence your votes will have.

The platform does not require that anybody purchase HP in order to participate, and there are many users who have earned a lot of Hive Power without spending any of their own money. You have the option of purchasing more Hive Power through your Hive.blog wallet.

## <span id="What_are_the_valid_reasons_for_downvoting">What are the valid reasons for downvoting?</span>

Users are allowed to downvote for any reason that they want. There are many users in the community who recommend only using the downvote on posts that are abusive. It is up to you if you want to follow this etiquette.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Voting_and_Curating">^</a>
## <span id="Does_a_downvote_mean_that_I_did_something_wrong">Does a downvote mean that I did something wrong?</span>

Just because you received a downvote does not mean that you did something wrong. The downvoting person may have just been voting to reallocate the rewards in a way that they felt was more beneficial to the other active posts in the platform. Often users will leave a comment explaining why they downvoted, but sometimes they might not. If they left a reason, it is up to you to determine if you did anything wrong, and if there is anything you want to change.

# Reputation

## <span id="What_is_Reputation">What is Reputation?</span>

Every user has a reputation score next to their name. The reputation score is one way Hive measures the amount of value you have brought to the community. It is also a mechanism that is designed to help reduce abuse of the Hive platform.

Your reputation goes up when accounts vote on your content. Getting downvoted by someone with a higher reputation can push your reputation down and make your posts less visible.

Users with a lower reputation score are unable to affect your reputation.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Reputation">^</a>
## <span id="How_is_the_Reputation_score_measured">How is the Reputation score measured?</span>

Every new user starts off with a reputation score of 25.

The reputation score is based off of a `log10` system, which means that a score of 40 is about 10x better than a score of 30.

More information about the calculation of the reputation score can be found in this post from @digitalnotvir:

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Reputation">^</a>
## <span id="How_do_I_improve_my_reputation_score">How do I improve my reputation score?</span>

Every time another user upvotes one of your posts or comments, it increases your reputation score. The more Hive Power that the voter has, the larger the effect is. The best way to earn upvotes is by adding value to the Hive community.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Reputation">^</a>
## <span id="What_causes_my_reputation_score_to_go_down">What causes my reputation score to go down?</span>

The only way for your reputation score to go down is to be downvoted by another user. Not all downvotes will cause a reputation loss though.

- Downvotes from users with a lower reputation score than you will not hurt your score.
- If your post or comment that was downvoted still received more upvotes than downvotes (weighted by HP), then the net effect on your reputation score will still be positive.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Reputation">^</a>
## <span id="Why_does_my_reputation_score_matter">Why does my reputation score matter?</span>

A reputation score is one way Hive measures the amount of value you have brought to the community. In real estate, they say there are three variables of the utmost importance: location, location, location. On Hive, those things are: reputation, reputation, reputation. It’s not to say other variables aren’t important, but reputation will be an enormous factor in your level of success.

Many users glance at other users’ reputation scores when deciding which articles to read because they know higher reputation scores means it is much more likely quality content. Furthermore, the higher your rep, the more effect your vote will have on the reputation of others.

It is worth noting that if your reputation score goes below 0, Hive.blog will hide your posts and comments making it very difficult to gain monetary rewards and followers. This incentivizes online etiquette and respect for your fellow users.

# Followers, Feeds, and Rehiving

## <span id="What_is_Rehiving">What is Rehiving?</span>

This is like reblogging or sharing posts on other platforms.  Once you rehive a post it will appear in your feed and in your followers' feeds as if you had posted it yourself.  Use it conservatively and with caution.  It is great to want to share content you like and appreciate with people you follow, but you don't want to overwhelm your followers either.

# Blockchain

## <span id="What_is_a_blockchain">What is a blockchain?</span>

A blockchain is a public ledger of all transactions ever executed. All of the transactions and data are stored in a distributed database. Each time the database is updated, all of updates are done together in a batch called a 'block'. Each time a new block is produced/added, it is appended on to all of the previous blocks - hence the name "blockchain".

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Blockchain">^</a>
## <span id="What_is_the_Hive_blockchain">What is the Hive blockchain?</span>

The Hive blockchain is the publicly accessible distributed database, which records all posts and votes, and distributes the rewards across the network. It is where all of the text content and voting data is stored, and it is where all of the reward calculations and payouts are performed.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Blockchain">^</a>
## <span id="How_do_Resource_Credits_work_on_the_Hive_blockchain">How do Resource Credits work on the Hive blockchain?</span>

Since transacting on the Hive blockchain has zero fees, transaction rate-limiting is employed to safeguard the blockchain from spam attacks. Everything action that you take on the blockchain will consume a small amount of Resource Credits. This includes posting, commenting, voting, transferring tokens, etc. Viewing content does not consume Resource Credits.

Every user has a limited amount of Resource Credits to use each week. The more transactions a user does, the less Resource Credits they will have left (until they recharge). Users with more Hive Power will have more Resource Credits.

When the blockchain becomes busy (due to heavy use), the Resource Credit cost of transactions may become higher than during times when the blockchain is less busy.

You can check how many Resource Credits you currently have at:
https://hiveblocks.com/@youraccount

If users do not have enough Resource Credits, they will be unable to transact with the blockchain until their Resource Credits recharge or they acquire additional Hive Power to increase their Resource Credit balance.

If you get an error that you have exceeded your Resource Credit allowance, it is normally best to just wait and try again later. Usually if you wait and try again later, the transaction will go through.

If you are unable to transact for extended periods of time, or you are frequently running into Resource Credit limits, then you will either need to reduce your usage to stay within your limit, or purchase more Hive Power for your account.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Blockchain">^</a>
## <span id="What_is_the_difference_between_Hive_and_Hive_blog">What is the difference between Hive and Hive.blog?</span>

Hive is the name of the blockchain that stores all of the data and transactions, and processes all of the events that take place. HIVE is also a name for the system’s value token (currency).

Hive.blog is a front end web interface to interact with the blockchain, and view the blockchain data.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Blockchain">^</a>
## <span id="How_is_Hive_different_from_Bitcoin">How is Hive different from Bitcoin?</span>

On a technical level, the two networks rely on the same model of a blockchain, but are built upon different technologies and codebase. Hive is based on a new state-of-the-art blockchain technology called Graphene, which uses "witnesses" instead of "miners" to produce blocks.

The "delegated proof of stake" model of using witnesses instead of miners allows for greater efficiency in block production. With BTC, 100% of the new coins that are created are allocated to block producers (miners). With the Hive blockchain, only 10% of the new coins are paid to block producers (witnesses). The other 90% of new HIVE coins are awarded to content producers, curators, and Hive Power holders.

## <span id="What_is_the_difference_between_Proof_of_Work__Proof_of_Stake__and_Delegated_Proof_of_Stake">What is the difference between Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Delegated Proof of Stake?</span>

**Proof of work** - Miners solve a complex mathematical problem. The miner that solves the problem first adds the block to the blockchain. The network rewards the miner for doing so.

**Proof of stake** - Requires ownership, or stake, in the cryptocurrency. The more tokens you own, the more block creation power you have. Benefits: eliminates the need for expensive mining rigs, runs on a tiny fraction of the power, and it requires block producers to have a stake in the network.

**Delegated proof of stake** - Block-creating accounts, called witnesses, are collectively approved by Hive stakeholders. Instead of relying on proof of work to find blocks, the Hive network actively schedules these accounts to improve the time between blocks to 3 seconds.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Blockchain">^</a>
## <span id="How_often_does_the_Hive_blockchain_produce_a_new_block">How often does the Hive blockchain produce a new block?</span>

The Hive blockchain schedules witnesses to produce a new block every 3 seconds. 21 witness nodes produce 21 blocks in each 63-second round.

# Security

## <span id="How_can_I_keep_my_Hive_account_secure">How can I keep my Hive account secure?</span>

<b>Save your master password and keep it somewhere safe.</b>

Only log into your account using the key with the appropriate permissions for what you are doing:
- Posting key for every day logins
- Active key when necessary for transfers, power ups, etc.
- Master password or owner key when changing the password

Again, <b>save your master password</b> and keep it safe! If logging in with your post key, make sure you don't overwrite or misplace your original master password.

It is not recommended to share your password or keys with any third party site.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Security">^</a>
## <span id="Why_should_I_be_careful_with_my_master_password">Why should I be careful with my master password?</span>

The master password is used to derive all keys for your account, including the owner key. If someone has access to your master password, they can steal your account and all of the tokens in it.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Security">^</a>
## <span id="Why_is_the_master_password_a_long_string_of_gibberish">Why is the master password a long string of gibberish?</span>

The password has to be long and random for maximum account security.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Security">^</a>
## <span id="What_are_my_different_keys_for">What are my different keys for?</span>

**Posting key** - The posting key allows accounts to post, comment, edit, vote, reblog, and follow or mute other accounts. Most users should be logging into Hive every day with the posting key. You are more likely to have your password or key compromised the more you use it so a limited posting key exists to restrict the damage that a compromised account key would cause.

**Active key** - The active key is meant for more sensitive tasks such as transferring funds, power up/down transactions, converting Hive Dollars, voting for witnesses, updating profile details and avatar, and placing a market order.

**Memo key** - Currently the memo key is not used.

**Owner key** - The owner key is only meant for use when necessary. It is the most powerful key because it can change any key of an account, including the owner key. Ideally it is meant to be stored offline, and only used to recover a compromised account.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Security">^</a>
## <span id="What_do_I_do_if_I_lost_my_password_keys">What do I do if I lost my password/keys?</span>

There is no way to recover your account if you lose your password or owner key! Because your account has real value, it is **very important** that you save your master password somewhere safe where you will not lose it.

It is strongly recommended that you store an offline copy of your password somewhere safe in case of a hard drive failure or other calamity. Consider digital offline storage, such as an external disk or flash drive, as well as printed paper. Use a safe deposit box for best redundancy.

No, liquid tokens can not be taken back if stolen or sent to the wrong account.

If your tokens are in Hive Power, it is impossible for a hacker to take out more than 1/13 per week. If your tokens are in savings, there is a three-day wait period for them to become transferable.

# Witnesses

## <span id="What_are_Hive_witnesses">What are Hive witnesses?</span>

The Hive blockchain requires a set of people to create blocks and uses a consensus mechanism called delegated proof of stake, or DPOS. The community elects 'witnesses' to act as the network's block producers and governance body. There are 20 full-time witnesses, producing a block every 63-second round. A 21st position is shared by the backup witnesses, who are scheduled proportionally to the amount of stake-weighted community approval they have. Witnesses are compensated with Hive Power for each block they create.
